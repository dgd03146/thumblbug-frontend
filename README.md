- Creators can create projects that can be sponsored before creating an idea product.
- Sponsors can select and sponsor sponsored items that include specific gifts after checking the creator's project plan and the gifts they can receive at the time of sponsorship.
- When the target amount set by the creator is reached, the project is successful, and the creator can produce the idea product himself and deliver the gift to the sponsor.
- Sponsors can check their sponsored projects and sponsored items in my sponsorship status.

## ðŸ’«Trouble Shooting


- **In the OS X environment in the React-quill editor, the phenomenon in which Korean letters are separated and entered in Chrome**

â†’ Resolve some escape characters by replacing them every time they are onChange

- **Make useQuery work only in certain situations.**

â†’ Give enabled as state, give the initial value of state as false, and change the state value when onClick.

- **Redux data received from the top selector within the return of useEffect does not come in**

â†’ Override at the top of the function component or check and resolve empty values with optional chaining.

- **How to scroll to other components with a dom element**

â†’ ForwradrRef delivers the ref value props to approach the dome element of the other component.
